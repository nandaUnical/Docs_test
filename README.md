# Foreing students master application @ University of Calabria
This repository belongs to a module of a web page project that allows foreing students to apply to master's courses at the University of Calabria. It is just a portal that is responsible for receiving applications and in a simple way to carry out all the steps for a correct application to the desired course.

## Final goal of this proyect:
  * Goal1
  * Goal2
  * Goal3

## What is happening?
Every year the [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it/) receives new students, italian and foreign, both for the triennial courses and for the master's degree courses. And every year many students are not able to enter because they miss some of the steps to complete the application correctly. All study programs have a limited enrollment, to access they must participate in an admission competition and they will be able to enroll only if they are admitted. 

To be admitted it is necessary to take a selective test or the [CISIA OnLine Test (TOLC)](https://www.cisiaonline.it/area-tematica-tolc-cisia/home-tolc-generale/) and together with all the information that is collected in the university portal, the application is built. The problem is that the two portals do not communicate each other and it is common for an application to be rejected just because they haven't the online exam results. 

To solve this problem, the idea of creating a single portal arises, where students interested in applying to a course can enter step by step, in a simple way, and gather all the necessary information in one place. This repository belongs to the module for the application of foreign students.
