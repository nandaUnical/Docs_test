# Foreing students master application @ University of Calabria
This repository belongs to a module of a web page project that allows foreing students to apply to master's courses at the University of Calabria. It is just a portal that is responsible for receiving applications and in a simple way to carry out all the steps for a correct application to the desired course.

## Final goal of this proyect:
  * Help students follow the application and admission process to the university correctly.
  * Present a single portal with a simple interface.
  * Ensure that all necessary information per student is available to built a solicitude.

## What is happening?
Every year the [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it/) receives new students, italian and foreign, both for the bachelor courses and for the master's degree courses. And every year many students are not able to enter because they miss some of the steps to complete the application correctly. 

To be admitted it is necessary to take a selective test or the [CISIA OnLine Test (TOLC)](https://www.cisiaonline.it/area-tematica-tolc-cisia/home-tolc-generale/) and with the information collected in the university portal, application is built. The problem is that the two portals do not communicate each other and it is common for an application to be rejected just because they haven't the online exam results. 

To solve this problem a sigle portal was created, where students interested in applying to a course can enter step by step all the necessary information in one place. 

## What the aplication does?

Using a single portal, students interested in applying to a master's course can start the admission process by leaving all the necessary documentation. The commission in charge of evaluating the candidates will upload an excel document with all those accepted. 

This repository belongs to the foreign students module, so, it only covers the application process for these types of students.

#### Used technologies:
 * [Django](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to develop back-end
 * [React](https://it.reactjs.org/) to develop front-end
